> Worrying does not take away tomorrow's problems, but it takes away today's peace.

Hi, I am Wangtianshu, a student in PKU majoring in CAT. I have no certain hobby, no addiction, believe no religion and never ever eat ginger (sad face). What I do have is a happy family and a beloved man (my sweet sweet QY). I read little, know little, but always love learning new skills. For those interest me or those necessary, I would love to persist. It would be nice if I can  live a decent and cozy life.
